## v1-simple-search

**Simple Search Demo**

Single search field centered on page with results underneath. No filters, no facets. Basic text search with fuzzy matching and prefix support.

---

## v2-faceted-features

**Faceted Search Demo**

Two-column UI with dynamic filters. Left panel has search box and filter categories (Type, Genre, Era, Tone, Morality, Archetype, Role, Profession, Reality, Location Type, Franchise). Filters update dynamically based on current results. Categories with no matching options are hidden.

Limitations:
- 1-hop relationship resolution only (characters don't inherit director names)
- No facet inheritance (characters don't inherit genre from movies)

## v3-filter-modifiers

**Filter Modifiers with 2-Hop Resolution**

- 2-hop relationship resolution: characters inherit names from movies and people (directors, etc.)
- Selective facet inheritance: characters/items/vehicles/locations inherit genre/era/tone from movies
- Filter modifier system with Option+click cycling:
  - `[tag]` (blue) = OR (default, broadens results)
  - `[! tag]` (red) = NOT (excludes)
  - `[+ tag]` (green) = MUST (narrows to intersection)
- MUST mode narrows visible filter options to compatible values
